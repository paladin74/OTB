\chapter{Building Simple Applications with OTB}
\label{chap:Tutorials}

Well, that's it, you've just downloaded and installed OTB, lured by the promise
that you will be able to do everything with it. That's true, you will be able
to do everything but - there is always a {\em but} - some effort is required.

OTB uses the very powerful systems of generic programing, many classes are
already available, some powerful tools are defined to help you with recurrent
tasks, but it is not an easy world to enter.

These tutorials are designed to help you enter this world and grasp the logic
behind OTB. Each of these tutorials should not take more than 10 minutes (typing
included) and each is designed to highlight a specific point. You may not be
concerned by the latest tutorials but it is strongly advised to go through the
first few which cover the basics you'll use almost everywhere.


\section{Hello world}
\label{sec:TutorialHelloWorld}

\index{Hello World}

\subsection{Linux and Mac OS X}

Let's start by the typical {\em Hello world} program. We are going to compile
this C++ program linking to your new OTB.

First, create a new folder to put your new programs (all the examples from this
tutorial) in and go into this folder.

Since all programs using OTB are handled using the CMake system, we need to create a
\code{CMakeLists.txt} that will be used by CMake to compile our program. An
example of this file can be found in the \code{OTB/Examples/Tutorials}
directory. The \code{CMakeLists.txt} will be very similar between your projects.

Open the \code{CMakeLists.txt} file and write in the few lines:


\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
PROJECT(Tutorials)

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)

FIND_PACKAGE(OTB)
IF(OTB_FOUND)
  INCLUDE(${OTB_USE_FILE})
ELSE(OTB_FOUND)
  MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR
      "Cannot build OTB project without OTB.  Please set OTB_DIR.")
ENDIF(OTB_FOUND)

ADD_EXECUTABLE(HelloWorldOTB HelloWorldOTB.cxx )
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(HelloWorldOTB ${OTB_LIBRARIES})
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}


The first line defines the name of your project as it appears in Visual Studio
(it will have no effect under UNIX or Linux). The second line loads a CMake file
with a predefined strategy for finding OTB \footnote{Similar files are provided
in CMake for other commonly used libraries, all of them named
\code{Find*.cmake}}. If the strategy for finding OTB fails, CMake will prompt
you for the directory where OTB is installed in your system. In that case you
will write this information in the \code{OTB\_DIR} variable. The line \code{
INCLUDE(\$\{USE\_OTB\_FILE\})} loads the \code{UseOTB.cmake} file to set all the
configuration information from OTB.

The line \code{ADD\_EXECUTABLE} defines as its first argument the name of the
executable that will be produced as result of this project. The remaining
arguments of \code{ADD\_EXECUTABLE} are the names of the source files to be
compiled and linked.  Finally, the \code{TARGET\_LINK\_LIBRARIES} line specifies
which OTB libraries will be linked against this project.

\input HelloWorldOTB.tex

Once the file is written, run \code{ccmake} on the current directory
(that is \code{ccmake ./} under Linux/Unix). If OTB is
on a non standard place, you will have to tell CMake where it is. Once your
done with CMake (you shouldn't have to do it anymore) run \code{make}.

You finally have your program. When you run it, you will have the {\em OTB Hello
World !} printed.

Ok, well done! You've just compiled and executed your first OTB program. Actually,
using OTB for that is not very useful, and we doubt that you downloaded OTB only
to do that. It's time to move on to a more advanced level.

\subsection{Windows}
\label{sec:FirstWinAppOTB}

Create a directory (with write access) where to store your work (for example at C:\textbackslash path\textbackslash to\textbackslash MyFirstCode).
Organize your repository as it :
\begin{itemize}
\item MyFirstCode\textbackslash src
\item MyFirstCode\textbackslash build
\end{itemize}

Follow the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a CMakeLists.txt into the src repository with the following lines:


\begin{verbatim}

project(MyFirstProcessing)

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)

find_package(OTB REQUIRED)
include(${OTB_USE_FILE})

add_executable(MyFirstProcessing MyFirstProcessing.cxx )

target_link_libraries(MyFirstProcessing ${OTB_LIBRARIES} )
\end{verbatim}

\item Create a MyFirstProcessing.cxx into the src repository with the following lines:
\begin{verbatim}
#include "otbImage.h"
#include "otbVectorImage.h"
#include "otbImageFileReader.h"
#include "otbImageFileWriter.h"
#include "otbMultiToMonoChannelExtractROI.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  if (argc < 3)
  {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << std::endl;
    std::cerr << argv[0] << "  inputImageFile  outputImageFile" << std::endl;
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }

  typedef unsigned short PixelType;
  typedef otb::Image <PixelType, 2> ImageType;
  typedef otb::VectorImage <PixelType, 2> VectorImageType;
  typedef otb::MultiToMonoChannelExtractROI <PixelType, PixelType> FilterType;
  typedef otb::ImageFileReader<VectorImageType> ReaderType;
  typedef otb::ImageFileWriter<ImageType> WriterType;

  FilterType::Pointer filter = FilterType::New();
  ReaderType::Pointer reader = ReaderType::New();
  WriterType::Pointer writer = WriterType::New();

  reader->SetFileName(argv[1]);
  filter->SetInput(reader->GetOutput());
  writer->SetFileName(argv[2]);
  writer->SetInput(filter->GetOutput());

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
\end{verbatim}
\item create a file named BuildMyFirstProcessing.bat into the MyFirstCode directory with the following lines:
\begin{verbatim}
@echo off

set /A ARGS_COUNT=0    
for %%A in (%*) do set /A ARGS_COUNT+=1  
if %ARGS_COUNT% NEQ 3 (goto :Usage)

if NOT DEFINED OSGEO4W_ROOT (goto :NoOSGEO4W)
	
set src_dir=%1
set build_dir=%2
set otb_install_dir=%3 
set current_dir=%CD%

cd %build_dir%

cmake %src_dir% ^
      -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH="%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\include" ^
      -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH="%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\lib" ^
      -DOTB_DIR:PATH=%otb_install_dir% ^
      -DCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES:STRING=Release

cmake --build . --target INSTALL --config Release

cd %current_dir%

goto :END

:Usage
echo You need to provide 3 arguments to the script: 
echo   1. path to the source directory
echo   2. path to the build directory
echo   3. path to the installation directory 
GOTO :END

:NoOSGEO4W
echo You need to run this script from an OSGeo4W shell
GOTO :END

:END
\end{verbatim}
\item into a OSGEo4W shell, run the configure.bat with the right arguments: full path to your src directory, full path to your build directory, full path to the place where find OTBConfig.cmake file (should be C:\textbackslash path\textbackslash to\textbackslash MyOTBDir\textbackslash install\textbackslash lib\textbackslash otb).
\item into the OSGeo4W shell, open the MyFirstProcessing.sln
\item build the solution
\item into the OSGeo4W shell, go to the bin\textbackslash Release directory and run MyFirstProcessing.exe. You can try for example with the otb\_logo.tif file which can be found into the OTB source.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Pipeline basics: read and write}
\label{sec:TutorialPipeline}

\index{Reader, Writer, Pipeline}

OTB is designed to read images, process them and write them to disk or
view the result. In this tutorial, we are going to see how to read and
write images and the basics of the pipeline system.

First, let's add the following lines at the end of the \code{CMakeLists.txt}
file:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
ADD_EXECUTABLE(Pipeline Pipeline.cxx )
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(Pipeline ${OTB_LIBRARIES})
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}


Now, create a \code{Pipeline.cxx} file.

\input Pipeline.tex

Once this file is written you just have to run \code{make}. The
\code{ccmake} call is not required anymore.

Get one image from the \code{OTB-Data/Examples} directory from the OTB-Data
repository. You can get it either by cloning the OTB data repository 
(\code{git clone https://git.orfeo-toolbox.org/otb-data.git}), but that might be quite 
long as this also gets the data to run the tests. Alternatively, you can get it from 
\url{http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/packages/OTB-Data-Examples.tgz}.
Take for example get \code{QB\_Suburb.png}.

Now, run your new program as \code{Pipeline QB\_Suburb.png output.png}. You
obtain the file \code{output.png} which is the same image as
\code{QB\_Suburb.png}. When you triggered the \code{Update()} method, OTB opened
the original image and wrote it back under another name.

Well\ldots that's nice but a bit complicated for a copy program!

Wait a minute! We didn't specify the file format anywhere! Let's try
\code{Pipeline QB\_Suburb.png output.jpg}. And voila! The output image is a jpeg
file.

That's starting to be a bit more interesting: this is not just a program to copy
image files, but also to convert between image formats.

You have just experienced the pipeline structure which executes the
filters only when needed and the automatic image format detection.

Now it's time to do some processing in between.


\section{Filtering pipeline}
\label{sec:TutorialFiltering}

\index{Filter, Pipeline}

We are now going to insert a simple filter to do some processing between the
reader and the writer.

Let's first add the 2 following lines to the \code{CMakeLists.txt} file:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
ADD_EXECUTABLE(FilteringPipeline FilteringPipeline.cxx )
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(FilteringPipeline ${OTB_LIBRARIES})
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\input{FilteringPipeline.tex}

Compile with \code{make} and execute as \code{FilteringPipeline QB\_Suburb.png
output.png}.

You have the filtered version of your image in the \code{output.png} file.

Now, you can practice a bit and try to replace the filter by one of the 150+
filters which inherit from the \doxygen{itk}{ImageToImageFilter} class. You
will definitely find some useful filters here!

\section{Handling types: scaling output}
\label{sec:TutorialScaling}

If you tried some other filter in the previous example, you may have noticed
that in some cases, it does not make sense to save the output directly as an
integer. This is the case if you tried the
\doxygen{itk}{CannyEdgeDetectionImageFilter}. If you tried to use it directly in
the previous example, you will have some warning about converting to unsigned
char from double.

The output of the Canny edge detection is a floating point number. A simple
solution would be to used double as the pixel type. Unfortunately, most image
formats use integer typed and you should convert the result to an integer image if you
still want to visualize your images with your usual viewer (we will see in a
tutorial later how you can avoid that using the built-in viewer).

To realize this conversion, we will use the
\doxygen{itk}{RescaleIntensityImageFilter}.

Add the two lines to the \code{CMakeLists.txt} file:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
ADD_EXECUTABLE(ScalingPipeline ScalingPipeline.cxx )
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(ScalingPipeline ${OTB_LIBRARIES})
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\input{ScalingPipeline}

As you should be getting used to it by now, compile with \code{make} and execute
as \code{ScalingPipeline QB\_Suburb.png output.png}.

You have the filtered version of your image in the \code{output.png} file.

\section{Working with multispectral or color images}

So far, as you may have noticed, we have been working with grey level images,
i.e. with only one spectral band. If you tried to process a color image with
some of the previous examples you have probably obtained a deceiving grey
result.

Often, satellite images combine several spectral band to help the
identification of materials: this is called multispectral imagery. In this
tutorial, we are going to explore some of the mechanisms used by OTB to
process multispectral images.

Add the following lines in the \code{CMakeLists.txt} file:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
ADD_EXECUTABLE(Multispectral Multispectral.cxx )
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(Multispectral ${OTB_LIBRARIES})
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\input{Multispectral}

Compile with \code{make} and execute as \code{./Multispectral qb\_RoadExtract.tif
 qb\_blue.tif qb\_shiftscale.tif}.

\section{Parsing command line arguments}
\label{sec:TutorialParsing}

Well, if you play with some other filters in the previous example, you probably
noticed that in many cases, you need to set some parameters to the filters.
Ideally, you want to set some of these parameters from the command line.

In OTB, there is a mechanism to help you parse the command line parameters. Let
try it!

Add the following lines in the \code{CMakeLists.txt} file:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
ADD_EXECUTABLE(SmarterFilteringPipeline SmarterFilteringPipeline.cxx )
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(SmarterFilteringPipeline ${OTB_LIBRARIES})
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\input{SmarterFilteringPipeline}

Compile with \code{make} as usual. The execution is a bit different now as we
have an automatic parsing of the command line. First, try to execute as
\code{SmarterFilteringPipeline} without any argument.

The usage message (automatically generated) appears:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
'--InputImage' option is obligatory !!!

 Usage : ./SmarterFilteringPipeline
      [--help|-h]           :  Help
      [--version|-v]        :  Version
       --InputImage|-in     :  input image file name   (1 parameter)
       --OutputImage|-out   :  output image file name   (1 parameter)
      [--SigmaD|-d]         :  Set the sigmaD parameter of the Harris points of
interest  algorithm. Default is 1.0.  (1 parameter)
      [--SigmaI|-i]         :  Set the SigmaI parameter of the Harris points of
interest  algorithm. Default is 1.0.  (1 parameter)
      [--Alpha|-a]          :  Set the alpha parameter of the Harris points of
interest  algorithm. Default is 1.0.  (1 parameter)
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

That looks a bit more professional: another user should be able to play with
your program. As this is automatic, that's a good way not to forget to
document your programs.

So now you have a better idea of the command line options that are possible. Try
\code{SmarterFilteringPipeline -in QB\_Suburb.png -out output.png} for a basic
version with the default values.

If you want a result that looks a bit better, you have to adjust the
parameter with \code{SmarterFilteringPipeline -in QB\_Suburb.png -out output.png
-d 1.5 -i 2 -a 0.1} for example.



\section{Going from raw satellite images to useful products}

Quite often, when you buy satellite images, you end up with several images. In the case of optical satellite, you often have a panchromatic spectral band with the highest spatial resolution and a multispectral product of the same area with a lower resolution. The resolution ratio is likely to be around 4.

To get the best of the image processing algorithms, you want to combine these data to produce a new image with the highest spatial resolution and several spectral band. This step is called fusion and you can find more details about it in \ref{sec:Fusion}. However, the fusion suppose that your two images represents exactly the same area. There are different solutions to process your data to reach this situation. Here we are going to use the metadata available with the images to produce an orthorectification as detailled in \ref{sec:Ortho}.

First you need to add the following lines in the \code{CMakeLists.txt} file:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
ADD_EXECUTABLE(OrthoFusion  OrthoFusion.cxx)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(OrthoFusion ${OTB_LIBRARIES})
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\input{OrthoFusion}
