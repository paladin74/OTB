Optimization algorithms are encapsulated as \doxygen{itk}{Optimizer} objects
within OTB. Optimizers are generic and can be used for applications other than
registration.  Within the registration framework, subclasses of
\doxygen{itk}{SingleValuedNonLinearOptimizer} are used to optimize the metric
criterion with respect to the transform parameters.

\index{itk::Optimizer!SetInitialPosition()}
\index{itk::Optimizer!StartOptimization()}
\index{itk::Optimizer!GetCurrentPosition()}

The basic input to an optimizer is a cost function object. In the context
of registration, \doxygen{itk}{ImageToImageMetric} classes provides this functionality.
The initial parameters are set using \code{SetInitialPosition()} and
the optimization algorithm is invoked by \code{StartOptimization()}.
Once the optimization has finished, the final parameters can be obtained
using \code{GetCurrentPosition()}.

\index{itk::Optimizer!SetScales()}
Some optimizers also allow rescaling of their individual parameters. This is
convenient for normalizing parameters spaces where some parameters have
different dynamic ranges. For example, the first parameter of
\doxygen{itk}{Euler2DTransform} represents an angle while the last two parameters
represent translations. A unit change in angle has a much greater impact on an
image than a unit change in translation. This difference in scale appears as
long narrow valleys in the search space making the optimization problem more
difficult. Rescaling the translation parameters can help to fix this problem.
Scales are represented as an \doxygen{itk}{Array} of doubles and set defined using
\code{SetScales()}.

There are two main types of optimizers in OTB. In the first type we find
optimizers that are suitable for dealing with cost functions that return a
single value. These are indeed the most common type of cost functions, and are
known as \emph{Single Valued} functions, therefore the corresponding optimizers
are known as \emph{Single Valued} optimizers. The second type of optimizers are
those suitable for managing cost functions that return multiple values at each
evaluation. These cost functions are common in model-fitting problems and are
known as \emph{Multi Valued} or \emph{Multivariate} functions.  The
corresponding optimizers are therefore called \emph{MultipleValued} optimizers
in OTB.

The \doxygen{itk}{SingleValuedNonLinearOptimizer} is the base class for the first
type of optimizers while the \doxygen{itk}{MultipleValuedNonLinearOptimizer} is the
base class for the second type of optimizers.

The types of single valued optimizer currently available in OTB are:

\index{itk::Levenberg\-Marquardt\-Optimizer}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Amoeba}: Nelder-Meade downhill simplex.  This optimizer is
actually implemented in the \code{vxl/vnl} numerics toolkit.  The ITK class
\doxygen{itk}{AmoebaOptimizer} is merely an adaptor class.

\item \textbf{Conjugate Gradient}: Fletcher-Reeves form
of the conjugate gradient with or without preconditioning
(\doxygen{itk}{ConjugateGradientOptimizer}). It is also an adaptor to an optimizer in
\code{vnl}.

\item \textbf{Gradient Descent}: Advances parameters in the direction of the
gradient where the step size is governed by a learning rate
(\doxygen{itk}{GradientDescentOptimizer}).

\item \textbf{Quaternion Rigid Transform Gradient Descent}: A specialized
version of GradientDescentOptimizer for QuaternionRigidTransform parameters,
where the parameters representing the quaternion are normalized to a magnitude
of one at each iteration to represent a pure rotation
(\doxygen{itk}{QuaternionRigidTransformGradientDescent}).

\item \textbf{LBFGS}: Limited memory Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb
and Shannon minimization. It is an adaptor to an optimizer in \code{vnl}
(\doxygen{itk}{LBFGSOptimizer}).

\item \textbf{LBFGSB}: A modified version of the LBFGS optimizer that allows to
specify bounds for the parameters in the search space.  It is an adaptor to an
optimizer in \code{netlib}. Details on this optimizer can be found
in~\cite{Byrd1995,Zhu1997} (\doxygen{itk}{LBFGSBOptimizer}).

\item \textbf{One Plus One Evolutionary}: Strategy that simulates the
biological evolution of a set of samples in the search space (\doxygen{itk}{OnePlusOneEvolutionaryOptimizer.}). Details on this optimizer can be
found in~\cite{Styner2000}.

\item \textbf{Regular Step Gradient Descent}: Advances parameters in the
direction of the gradient where a bipartition scheme is used to compute
the step size (\doxygen{itk}{RegularStepGradientDescentOptimizer}).

\item \textbf{Powell Optimizer}: Powell optimization method.  For an
N-dimensional parameter space, each iteration minimizes(maximizes) the function
in N (initially orthogonal) directions. This optimizer is described
in~\cite{Press1992}.  (\doxygen{itk}{PowellOptimizer}).

\item \textbf{SPSA Optimizer}: Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic
Approximation Method. This optimizer is described in
\url{http://www.jhuapl.edu/SPSA} and in~\cite{Spall1998}.
(\doxygen{itk}{SPSAOptimizer}).

\item \textbf{Versor Transform Optimizer}: A specialized version of the
RegularStepGradientDescentOptimizer for VersorTransform
parameters, where the current rotation is composed with the gradient rotation
to produce the new rotation versor. It follows the definition of versor
gradients defined by Hamilton~\cite{Hamilton1866}
(\doxygen{itk}{VersorTransformOptimizer}).

\item \textbf{Versor Rigid3D Transform Optimizer}: A specialized version of the
RegularStepGradientDescentOptimizer for VersorRigid3DTransform parameters,
where the current rotation is composed with the gradient rotation to produce
the new rotation versor. The translational part of the transform parameters are
updated as usually done in a vector space.
(\doxygen{itk}{VersorRigid3DTransformOptimizer}).


\end{itemize}

A parallel hierarchy exists for optimizing multiple-valued cost functions. The
base optimizer in this branch of the hierarchy is the
\doxygen{itk}{MultipleValuedNonLinearOptimizer} whose only current derived class
is:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Levenberg Marquardt}: Non-linear least squares minimization.
Adapted to an optimizer in \code{vnl} (\doxygen{itk}{LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer}).
This optimizer is described in~\cite{Press1992}.

\end{itemize}


Figure \ref{fig:OptimizersHierarchy} illustrates the full class hierarchy of
optimizers in OTB. Optimizers in the lower right corner are adaptor classes
to optimizers existing in the \code{vxl/vnl} numerics toolkit. The optimizers
interact with the \doxygen{itk}{CostFunction} class. In the registration framework
this cost function is reimplemented in the form of ImageToImageMetric.
