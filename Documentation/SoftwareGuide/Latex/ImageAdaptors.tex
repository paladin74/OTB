CastImageFilter and an ImageAdaptor.  ImageAdaptors
convert pixel values when they are accessed by iterators.  Thus, they do not

illustrated by this figure, the \emph{Image Y} is not created by the
ImageAdaptor; instead, the image is simulated on the fly each time an
iterator from the filter downstream attempts to access the image data.}

The purpose of an \emph{image adaptor} is to make one image appear
like another image, possibly of a different pixel type.  A typical
example is to take an image of pixel type \code{unsigned char} and
present it as an image of pixel type \code{float}. The motivation for
using image adaptors in this case is to avoid the extra memory
resources required by using a casting filter.  When we use the
\doxygen{itk}{CastImageFilter} for the conversion, the filter creates a
memory buffer large enough to store the \code{float} image. The
\code{float} image requires four times the memory of the
original image and contains no useful additional information. Image
adaptors, on the other hand, do not require the extra memory as
pixels are converted only when they are read using image iterators
(see Chapter~\ref{sec:ImageIteratorsChapter}).

Image adaptors are particularly useful when there is infrequent pixel access,
since the actual conversion occurs on the fly during the access operation. In
such cases the use of image adaptors may reduce overall computation time as
well as reduce memory usage. The use of image adaptors, however, can be
disadvantageous in some situations. For example, when the downstream filter
is executed multiple times, a CastImageFilter will cache its output after the
first execution and will not re-execute when the filter downstream is
updated. Conversely, an image adaptor will compute the cast every time.

Another application for image adaptors is to perform lightweight
pixel-wise operations replacing the need for a filter. In the toolkit,
adaptors are defined for many single valued and single parameter
functions such as trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic
functions. For example,
\begin{itemize}
\item \doxygen{itk}{ExpImageAdaptor}
\item \doxygen{itk}{SinImageAdaptor}
\item \doxygen{itk}{CosImageAdaptor}
\end{itemize}

The following examples illustrate common applications of image adaptors.

\section{Adaptors and Writers}

Image adaptors will not behave correctly when connected directly to a writer.
The reason is that writers tend to get direct access to the image buffer from
their input, since image adaptors do not have a real buffer their behavior in
this circumstances is incorrect. You should avoid instantiating the
\code{ImageFileWriter} or the \code{ImageSeriesWriter} over an image adaptor
type.
