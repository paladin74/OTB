\chapter{Reading and Writing Images}
\label{sec:IO}

This chapter describes the toolkit architecture supporting reading and
writing of images to files. OTB does not enforce any particular file
format, instead, it provides a structure inherited from ITK,
supporting a variety of formats that can be easily extended by the
user as new formats become available.

We begin the chapter with some simple examples of file I/O.

The following section describes the internals of the IO architecture provided
in the toolbox.

\section{Pluggable Factories}
\label{sec:ImageIOPluggableFactories}

The principle behind the input/output mechanism used in ITK and
therefore OTB is known as
\emph{pluggable-factories} \cite{Gamma1995}. This concept is illustrated in
the UML diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOCollaborationDiagram}. From the
user's point of view the objects responsible for reading and writing files
are the \doxygen{otb}{ImageFileReader} and \doxygen{otb}{ImageFileWriter}
classes. These two classes, however, are not aware of the details involved in
reading or writing particular file formats like PNG or GeoTIFF.  What they do
is to dispatch the user's requests to a set of specific classes that are
aware of the details of image file formats. These classes are the
\doxygen{itk}{ImageIO} classes. The ITK delegation mechanism enables users to
extend the number of supported file formats by just adding new classes to the
ImageIO hierarchy.

Each instance of ImageFileReader and ImageFileWriter has
a pointer to an ImageIO object. If this pointer is empty, it will
be impossible to read or write an image and the image file reader/writer must
determine which ImageIO class to use to perform IO operations.
This is done basically by passing the filename to a centralized class, the
\doxygen{itk}{ImageIOFactory} and asking it to identify any subclass of
ImageIO capable of reading or writing the user-specified file. This
is illustrated by the use cases on the right side of
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesUseCases}. The ImageIOFactory acts here as a
dispatcher that help to locate the actual IO factory classes corresponding to
each file format.

Each class derived from ImageIO must provide an associated factory
class capable of producing an instance of the ImageIO class. For
example, for PNG files, there is a \doxygen{itk}{PNGImageIO} object that knows how
to read this image files and there is a \doxygen{itk}{PNGImageIOFactory} class
capable of constructing a PNGImageIO object and returning a pointer
to it.  Each time a new file format is added (i.e., a new ImageIO
subclass is created), a factory must be implemented as a derived class of the
ObjectFactoryBase class as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesClassDiagram}.

For example, in order to read PNG files, a PNGImageIOFactory is
created and registered with the central ImageIOFactory
singleton\footnote{\emph{Singleton} means that there is only one instance of
this class in a particular application} class as illustrated in the left side
of Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesUseCases}. When the ImageFileReader asks
the ImageIOFactory for an ImageIO capable of reading the
file identified with \emph{filename} the ImageIOFactory will iterate over the
list of registered factories and will ask each one of them is they know how
to read the file. The factory that responds affirmatively will be used to
create the specific ImageIO instance that will be returned to the
ImageFileReader and used to perform the read operations.

With respect to the ITK formats, OTB adds most of the remote sensing
image formats. In order to do so, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, GDAL
      \url{http://www.gdal.org/}, is encapsultated in a ImageIO
      factory. GDAL is a translator library for raster
      geospatial data formats that is released under an X/MIT style
      Open Source license. As a library, it presents a single abstract
      data model to the calling application for all supported formats,
      which include CEOS, GeoTIFF, ENVI, and much more. See
      \url{http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html} for
      the full format list.

      Since GDAL is itself a multi-format library, the GDAL IO
factory is able to choose the appropriate ressource for reading and
writing images.

In most cases the mechanism is transparent to the user who only interacts
with the ImageFileReader and ImageFileWriter. It is
possible, however, to explicitly select the type of ImageIO object
to use.  Please see the ITK Software for more details about this.

Images whose pixel type is a Vector, a CovariantVector, an Array, or a Complex
are quite common in image processing. One of the uses of these tye of
images is the processing of SLC SAR images, which are complex.

\section{Extended filename for reader and writer}
\label{sec:Reading Image Series}

\subsection{Purpose}

There are multiple ways to define geo-referencing information. For instance,
 one can use a geographic transform, a cartographic projection, or a sensor 
model with RPC coefficients. A single image may contain several of these 
elements, such as in the "ortho-ready" products : this is a type of product 
still in sensor geometry (the sensor model is supplied with the image) 
but it also contains an approximative geographic transform that can be used 
to have a quick estimate of the image localisation. For instance, your product
may contain a ".TIF" file for the image, along with a ".RPB" file that contains
the sensor model coefficients and an ".IMD" file that contains a cartographic 
projection. 

This case leads to the following question : which geo-referencing element
should be used when opening this image in an OTB reader. In fact, it depends on
the users need. For an orthorectification application, the sensor model must be
used. In order to specify which information should be skipped, a syntax of 
extended filenames has been developped for both reader and writer. 


\subsection{Syntax}

The reader and writer extended file name support is based on the same syntax,
only the options are different.  To benefit from the extended file name
mecanism, the following syntax is to be used:

\begin{verbatim}
Path/Image.ext?&key1=<value1>&key2=<value2>
\end{verbatim}

IMPORTANT: Note that you'll probably need to "quote" the filename.

\subsection{Reader options}

\textbf{Available Options:}

\begin{itemize}

\item \begin{verbatim}&geom=<path/filename.geom>\end{verbatim}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Contains the file name of a valid geom file
  \item Use the content of the specified geom file instead of image-embedded
    geometric information
  \item empty by default, use the image-embedded information if available
  \end{itemize}  
\item \begin{verbatim}&sdataidx=<(int)idx>\end{verbatim}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Select the sub-dataset to read
  \item 0 by default
  \end{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}&resol=<(int)resolution factor>\end{verbatim}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Select the JPEG2000 sub-resolution image to read
  \item 0 by default
  \end{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}&skipcarto=<(bool)true>\end{verbatim}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Skip the reading of internal RPC tags (see \ref{sec:TypesofSensorModels} for details)
  \item false by default. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Writer options}

\textbf{Available Options:}

\begin{itemize}

\item \begin{verbatim}&writegeom=<(bool)false>\end{verbatim}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To activate writing of external geom file

  \item Activates configuration of streaming through extended filenames
  \item Override any previous configuration of streaming
  \item Allows to configure the kind of streaming to perform
  \item Available values are:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item auto : tiled or stripped streaming mode chosen automatically depending on TileHint read from input files
    \item tiled : tiled streaming mode
    \item stripped : stripped streaming mode
    \item none : explicitly deactivate streaming 
    \end{itemize}
  \item Not set by default 
  \end{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}&streaming:sizemode=<VALUE>\end{verbatim}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Allows to choose how the size of the streaming pieces is computed
  \item Available values are:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item auto  : size is estimated from the available memory setting by evaluating pipeline memory print
    \item height : size is set by setting height of strips or tiles
    \item nbsplits : size is computed from a given number of splits 
    \end{itemize}
  \item Default is auto 
  \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Parameter for size of streaming pieces computation
    \item Value is :
      \begin{itemize}
        \item if sizemode=auto : available memory in Mb
        \item if sizemode=height : height of the strip or tile in pixels
        \item if sizemode=nbsplits : number of requested splits for streaming 
      \end{itemize}
    \item If not provided, the default value is set to 0 and result in different behaviour depending on sizemode (if set to height or nbsplits, streaming is deactivated, if set to auto, value is fetched from configuration or cmake configuration file) 
\end{itemize}

\item \begin{verbatim}&box=<startx>:<starty>:<sizex>:<sizey>\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User defined parameters of output image region
    \item The region must be set with 4 unsigned integers (the separator used is
      the colon ':'). Values are:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item startx: first index on X
        \item starty: first index on Y
        \item sizex: size along X
        \item sizey: size along Y 
      \end{itemize}
    \item The definition of the region follows the same convention as itk::Region
    definition in C++. A region is defined by two classes: the itk::Index and
    itk::Size classes. The origin of the region within the image with which it
    is associated is defined by Index 
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

The available syntax for boolean options are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ON, On, on, true, True, 1 are available for setting a 'true' boolean value
    \item OFF, Off, off, false, False, 0 are available for setting a 'false' boolean value
\end{itemize}
