An hyperspectral image contains a collection of spectral pixels or
equivalently, a collection of spectral bands.

  \label{fig:cube}
\end{figure}

An hyperspectral system \ref{fig:cube} acquired
radiance, each pixel contains fine spectral information
fine that depends of:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Spectrum of the light source (in practice, the
sun) and atmospheric disturbances.}
\item{Spectral responses
of different materials in the overlap zone and of the nature of the mixture.}
\end{itemize}

Preliminary treatments allow to perform 
atmospheric correction for estimating a reflectance cube
spectral by subtraction of information extrinsic of the
scene (see also \ref{secAtmosphericCorrections}).
 
\section{Unmixing}

\subsection{Linear mixing model}

Reflectance information depends only of the materials spectral responses in the scene. When the mixture between
materials is macroscopic, the linear mixing model of spectra
is generally admitted. In this case, the image typically looks like this:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Linear_Unmixing_HPX.eps}
  \itkcaption[Linear mixing model]{Zone which verify the LM model.}
  \label{fig:linear_unmixing}
\end{figure}

We notice \ref{fig:linear_unmixing} the
presence of pure pixels, and pixel-blending. The LMM acknowledges that
reflectance spectrum associated with each pixel is a linear combination of pure materials in the recovery area, commonly known as ``''endmembers. This is illustrated in \ref{fig:decomp_mml}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Decomposition_MML_HPX.eps}
  \itkcaption[Decomposition of the LMM]{Decomposition of a hyperspectral cube according to the LMM.}
  \label{fig:decomp_mml}
\end{figure}
The `` left'' term represents the different spectral bands of
data cube. The `` right'' term represents a `` product''
between the reflectance spectra of endmembers and their repective abundances. Abundance band of endmembers is
image grayscale between $0$ and $1$. The pixel i of the
abundance band of endmember j is $s_ {ji}$. This value is the
abundance of endmember j in the pixel i. Under certain conditions
~\cite{Huck2009}, this value can be interpreted as the ratio
surface of the material in the overlap zone (\ref{fig:linear_unmixing}). In
practice, one can reasonably expect that: 

\begin{itemize}
\item{a limit number
of pure materials compose the scene.}
\item{the scene contains pure pixels if the spatial resolution is sufficient and
do not necessarily contains them otherwise.}
\end{itemize}

Many techniques of unmixing in hyperspectral image analysis
are based on geometric approach where each pixel is seen as a spectral
vector of L (number of spectral bands). The
spectral bands can then be written as vectors.

By deduction of \ref{fig:decomp_mml} et de \ref{fig:mml}, the LMM needs to decompose R as: 
\begin{center}
$R= A.S + N = X + N$
\end{center}

J is the number of endmembers and the number of spectral pixels I:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item{J columns of the matrix A contain the spectra of endmembers.}
\item{J rows of the matrix S contain the abundance maps
vectorized, we call the columns vectors of abundances of
matrix S.}
\item{The matrix N, of dimensions $LXI$ is a matrix of additive noise.}
\end{itemize}

The unmixing problem is to estimate matrices A and S
from R or possibly of \"X, an estimate of the denoised matrix signal.

Several physical constraints can be taken into
account to solve the unmixing problem:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item{C1: reflectance spectra are positives (non negative matrix A).}
\item{C2: positivity abundances are positive (non-negative matrix S).}
\item{C3: additivity
abundance (the sum of the coefficients of each column of the matrix S is 1).}
\item{Independence between the ``algebraic spectral vectors'' of endmembers associated with linearity and mixtures of spectra, so that the simplex property described in paragraph below.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simplex}  
Recent unmixing algorithms based on the ``property of
simplex.'' In a vector space of dimension $J-1$, we can
associate to J vectors algebrically independent, J points which define the vertices of a J-simplex \ref{fig:simplex}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Simplex_HPX.eps}
  \itkcaption[Simplex]{Illustration of a 2-simplex, a 3-simplex and a 4-simplex.}
  \label{fig:simplex}
\end{figure}

Hyperspectral cube of L bands, based on J endmembers,
may be contained in a affine subspace of dimension $J-1$.
A relevant subspace in the sense of signal-to-noise ratio is
generally obtained by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \ref{sec:RoadExtraction}. 
In practice, the $J-1$ eigenvectors associated with highest values are
the columns of a projection matrix V of dimension $(Lx(J-1))$. Reduced
data Z, of dimensions $((J-1)xI)$ are obtained by the operation:
$Z=V^{T}(\tilde{R})$

where each column of $\tilde{R}$ where the average spectrum is substracted,
generally estimated under maximum likelihood. In the
subspace carrying the column-vectors Z, endmembers spectra oare associated to the top of the simplex. If the noise is
negligible, the simplex circumscribed reduced data.

This property shows that the endmembers research are the vertices of a
simplex that circumscribes the data. However, an infinity of different
simplices can identify the same data set. In fact, the problem of
unmixing generally does not have a unique solution. This degeneration can also be
demonstrated by the formalism of the non-negative
matrices factorization \cite{Huck2010a}.

It is therefore necessary to choose the most physically
relevant solution. All unmixing techniques based on this simplex property admit that the best solution is defined by the allowable
minimum volume simplex, or the notion of volume is extended to all
finite dimensions (possibly different from 3).
  

\subsection{State of the art unmixing algorithms selection} 
The more recent linear unmixing algorithms exploit the
simplex property. It is possible to classify these methods into several families:

\subsubsection{Family 1} 
A first family of unmixing algorithms are based on research of the
endmembers ``among'' data. This means that a minimum of one pure pixel must
be associated with each endmembers. If this hypothesis is not
verified, it will produce an estimation error of the endmembers spectra. The historical advantage of these algorithms are their low
algorithmic complexity. The three best known are :
\begin{itemize}
\item PPI (Pixel Purity Index)
\item VCA NFINDER (Vertex Component Analysis) \cite{Nascimento2005}
\end{itemize}

In addition to its success recognized by the
community and very competitive algorithmic complexity, the endmembers estimation is unbiased in absence of noise (and when there are pure pixels).

\paragraph{VCA} 
The VCA algorithm is systematically
used to initialize various studied algorithms (except
MVES, based on a different initialization).

Important elements on the operation of VCA:
\begin{itemize}
\item {The VCA algorithm
is based on iterative projections of the data orthogonal to
the subspace already held by the endmembers.}
\item {Biaised when degree of purity is lower than 1.}
\end{itemize}  

\subsubsection{Family 2} 
A second family is composed of algorithms which are looking for the simplex of minimum
volume circumscribing the data. Phase initialization consists in determining
an initial simplex any circumscribing the data. Then, a numerical
optimization scheme minimizes a functional, increasing function of the
volume generalized, itself dependent of estimated endmembersin the
current iteration. The optimization scheme is constrained by the fact that the
data have remained on the simplex and possibly by constraints C1, C2 and C3.

Existing algorithms are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item {MVSA (Minimum Volume Simplex
Analysis) \cite{Li2008}.}
\item { MVES (Minimum Volume Encosing Simplex)
[Chan2009].}
\item {SISAL (Simplex Identification via Split Augmented
Lagrangian) \cite{Dias2009}.}
\end{itemize}  
  
Main differences between algorithms are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item {The numerical optimization scheme.}
\item {The way
constraints are taken into account.}

\end{itemize}  
These issues impact the computational complexity and the precision of the estimation.
 
\paragraph{MVSA \cite{Li2008} } 
MVSA key points: 
\begin{itemize}
\item {Initialization by VCA.}
\item {All spectral pixels included in the simplex estimate
  (approximatively) by VCA does not impact the constraint of  data to belong to the researched simplex, they are
  simply delete the data used in the minimization of the
  simplex to reduce the algorithmic complexity.}
\item {The highly developed optimization technique uses
  sequential quadratic programming (Sequential Quadratic
  Programming - SQP) and more specifically of the category
  ``Quasi-Newton''under constraint.}
\end{itemize} 

\paragraph{MVES \cite{Chan2009}}
 MVES key points: 
\begin{itemize}
\item {Initialization by non-trivial
  iterative method (LP Linear Programming for Linear
  Programming), different from VCA.}
\item {Resolution of problem by LP.}
\end{itemize} 
 

\paragraph{SISAL \cite{Dias2009}}
SISAL key points:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Initialisation by VCA.}
\item {Selection of similar spectral pixels as MVSA to reduce computational complexity.}
\item {Advanced optimization technique
combining multiple features.}
\begin{itemize}
\item {Decomposition of the non convex problem
in convex set of problems.}
\item {Development of a
specific method of separation of variables for considering
Lagrangian increases with a good design properties.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{Family 3}
Non negative matrix factorization algorithms (NMF for Non-negative Matrix Factorization). The purpose of this
branch of applied mathematics is to factor a non-negative matrix, X in our case, into a product of non negative matrices: AS by minimizing a distance between X and AS and
with an adapted regularization to lift the degeneration in an appropriate manner adapted to the physical problems associated with unmixing.

\paragraph{MDMD-NMF \cite{Huck2010b}} 
Key points of MDMD-NMF:
\begin{itemize}
\item {VCA initialization.}
\item {Minimizing the norm of standard
Frobenius with a spectral regularization and a regularization ``Space''(the matrix of abundances).}
\begin{itemize}
\item {Minimum spectral
Dispersion: the spectral regularization encourages the  variance of 
coefficients of a spectrum of endmembers to be low.}
\item {Maximum spatial dispersion: the spatial regularization
  encourages the vector of abundances to occupy all the admissible parts (more information in \cite{Huck2009}). it
  presents a certain analogy with the minimum volume constraint.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
 
 
  

\subsubsection{Further remarks}
Algorithms of families 1 and 2 estimate `` only'' the spectra of
endmembers. The estimated abundance maps held
\textit{a posteri} and requires the application of an algorithm like Fully
Constrained Least Square (FCLS)\doxygen{otb}{FCLSUnmixingImageFilter} \cite{Heinz2001}. VSS includes an specific algorithm
for the estimation of the abundances.
The unmixing is a general non-convex problem,
which explains the importance of the initialization of algorithms.

\section{Anomaly detection}
By definition, an anomaly in a scene is an element that does not
expect to find. The unusual element is likely different from its
environment and its presence is in the minority scene. Typically, a
vehicle in natural environment, a rock in a field, a wooden hut in a
forest are anomalies that can be desired to detect using a
hyperspectral imaging. This implies that the spectral response of the
anomaly can be discriminated in the spectral response of ``background
clutter''. This also implies that the pixels associated to anomalies,
the anomalous pixels are sufficiently rare and/or punctual to be
considered as such. These properties can be viewed as spectral and
spatial hypotheses on which the techniques of detection anomalies in
hyperspectral images rely on.


Literature on hyperspectral imaging
generally distinguishes target detection and detection
anomalies:

\begin{itemize}
\item {We speak of detection of targets when the spectral response
element of the research is used as input to
the detection algorithm. This is an \textit{a priori} information that
can, in theory, allow to construct algorithms with very high
detection score, such as for example the Adaptive Matched Filter (AMF) or Adaptive
Cosine/Coherence Estimator (ACE). Nevertheless,
thin enough knowledge of the researched spectrum is a difficult 
information to hold in practice, leading the use of anomaly detection algorithms.}

\item {We speak of detection of anomalies (or outliers) when the spectrum
  of the unusual element is not required by the algorithm. For this reason, we often associate the term
  ``Unsupervised'' detection. Nevertheless, these algorithms depend
  generally of ``structural'' parameters. For example, in the case
  of detection on a sliding window, selecting the right
  dimensions is based on an \textit{a priori} knowledge of the anomalies size. 
  We focus here on algorithms for \bf{anomaly detection}.}

\end{itemize}
    
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Anomaly_HYP.eps}
  \itkcaption[Concept of detection]{Notions on detection: ground truth mask, map detection, face detection.}
  \label{fig:anomaly_hyp}
\end{figure}

In \ref{fig:anomaly_hyp}, we introduce some notions that will be useful later. Anomaly detection algorithms have an image as input and consider a map
serving as a detection tool for making a decision. A
adaptive thresholding provides a estimated mask detection that
we hope is the most similar possible as the ground truth mask,
unknown in practice.

Two approaches dominate the state of the art in anomaly detection
in hyperspectral images. Methods which use Pursuit
Projection (PP) and methods based on a probabilistic modelization of the background and possibly of the target class
with statistical hypothesis tests.
The PP consists in projecting linearly spectral pixels on
vectors wi which optimizes a criterion sensitive to the presence of anomalies
(like Kurtosis). This gives a series of maps of projections
where anomalies contrast very strongly with the background. But the automatic estimation of map  detection have also major difficulties, including:

\begin{itemize} 
\item How many projectors should I consider?  
\item What (s) projector (s) to choose?  
\item How to manage an inhomogeneous background?  
\item Detection performances varies with the spatial dimensions of the image (number of samples) 
\item These algorithms usually do not have a structure allowing parallelization
\item These algorithms do not generally have a ``constant false alarm rate''.
\end{itemize}

Algorithms described here are RX (presented in the first version
in \cite{Reed1990} and GMRF \cite{Schweizer2001}. They are based on probability models, statistics and hypothesis tests and
sliding window. These approaches consist in answering the following question : ``The pixel (or set of neighboring pixels) tests looks like background pixels?'', by a process of test
statistics. More fully, this approach requires:

\begin{itemize} 
\item A model for the background 
\item The choice of a statistic test 
\item Eventually, a model for the class ``anomaly''
\item Estimators for the parameters \textit{a priori} unknown
\item Hypothesis of homogeneity for a satisfactory compromise between:
\begin{itemize} 
\item The number of samples compared to the number of estimate parameters 
\item The homogeneity, including the background 
\item Algorithmic complexity (although the algorithms considered are
highly parallelizable)
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize} 
Principle of RX and GMRF can be resume with \ref{fig:workflow_anomaly}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Anomaly_Detection_Workflow.eps}
  \itkcaption[Anomaly detection block diagram]{Basic workflow of anomaly detection in hyperspectral images.}
  \label{fig:workflow_anomaly}
\end{figure}

An optional first step is to reduce the size of spectral data
while maintaining information related to anomalies. Then, the spectral pixels
are tested one by oneturn (parallelizable task). The pixel
test works on a sliding window (see \ref{fig:sliding_anomaly}). This
window consists of two sub windows, centered on the pixel test of  dimensions L and LL, with $L<LL$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Pixels belonging to the annulus formed the class ``local background''. The statistical parameters of the background,
  required by statistical tests, are estimated from these
  spectral pixels. One of the challenges is to find a
  compromise on the thickness of the annulus (and therefore the number
  statistical sampling) where:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item If the annulus is too thick, the local background  is no longer homogeneous
\item If the number of samples is too low, the precision of
  the statistical estimation of the model parameters for the background is too
  low
\end{itemize}  
\item Pixels of the central part of the sliding window
  belong to the class ``unknown''. If the test pixel (central pixel) is an anomaly, it is possible that its neighbors
  pixels are also anomalies, which imply to not to choose
  a too small value for L if it is known that anomalies
  can be distribute over several pixels.
\end{itemize}  
Once all the parameters are estimated, a statistical test is performed and assigns a
value $\Lambda(i)$ to the tested pixel i. A map of detection is thus
formed.
