\chapter{Applications}
\label{sec:Applications}

This chapter introduces a set of ready-to-use applications. 
These applications were designed to perform  simple remote sensing tasks, 
more complex than simple examples, to demonstrate the use of the OTB 
functions. They were previously known as the OTB-Applications 
package but are now part of the OTB library. The new framework is 
slightly different from before but they can be used pretty much the 
same way: each application has its set of inputs, outputs, parameters. 
The applications can be lauched as a command line interface but also
via a Qt GUI. In addition, they can be wrapped for SWIG and PyQt. For a 
complete list of these applications, please refer to the 
\href{http://orfeo-toolbox.org/Applications}{applications documentation}.
