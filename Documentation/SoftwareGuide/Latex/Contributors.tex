The ORFEO Toolbox is a project conducted by CNES and developed in
cooperation with CS (Communication \& Syst\`{e}mes), \url{http://www.c-s.fr}.\\

This Software Guide is based on the ITK Software Guide: the build
process for the documentation, many examples and even the \LaTeX~ ~
sources were taken from ITK. We are very grateful to the ITK
developers and contributors and especially to Luis Ib\'a\~nez.\\

The OTB specifics were implemented and documented by the OTB Development Team with some help from several contributors. Without these people\footnote{this list has been generated at random without any hierarchy or amount of contribution consideration}, OTB will not be where it is today:

Contributions from users are expected and encouraged for the coming
versions of the ORFEO ToolBox.
